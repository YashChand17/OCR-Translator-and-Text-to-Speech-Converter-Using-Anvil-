🚀 Excited to share my project "OCR Translator and Text to Speech Converter Using Anvil"  📝🔍🔊

🔍 What's it about?
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a crucial technology that converts images of typed, handwritten, or printed text into machine-readable text. In this project, I've leveraged Python's powerful libraries alongside Anvil technology to create a seamless OCR Translator and Text-to-Speech converter.

🛠️ Key Features:

OCR Translation: The system effortlessly extracts text from images using the EasyOCR library, supporting multiple languages for diverse applications.

Language Translation: Powered by Google Translate, the project offers seamless translation of extracted text into various languages.

Text-to-Speech Conversion: With the gTTS library, users can listen to translated text in their preferred language through audio output.

💡 Why it matters:
This project streamlines the process of extracting, translating, and vocalizing text from images, offering practical solutions for scenarios ranging from document digitization to multilingual communication.

🌐 Technologies used:

Python: For backend development and integration of OCR and translation functionalities.

Anvil: For creating an intuitive and user-friendly web application interface.

Google Cloud Services: For language translation using the Google Translate API.

👨‍💻 How it works:
Users simply upload an image containing text through the Anvil web interface. The system then extracts the text using OCR, translates it into the desired language, and converts it into speech for convenient consumption.
